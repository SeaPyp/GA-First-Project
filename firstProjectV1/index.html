			<div class ="storyText">Your name is Barry - yes, a name to inspire the utmost fear in all of your enemies.  Also, it's <b><i>definitely</i></b> the only reason why Chad and his friends avoided you at school.  <br><br>You have been unwittingly (and wittlessly - get it) thrown into this quest to save the kingdom from the ravages of Varothar!!  (Now that's a name!!)  *We're just going to pause for a few moments while everyone stops quivering and can read again * ... (elevator music plays) ... .  <br><br>Right, so Varothar *pauses again*  has managed to escape from that very special prison that Seamus Airion (no pressure <i>Barry</i>) confined him to!  He is now planning on destroying all of the world unless someone can stop him.  <br><br>Owing to other (much more fun and better paying games) we are left with you to defend us, and vanquish the foul lord Varothar .... ! (Yes, that was another shamelss pause!)  <br><br>Or at least give us enough time to build an underground shelter!</div>
